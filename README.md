# About this project
Simple calculator app created using QT Creator


# Project goals

The purpose of this project is to make myself more familiar with the development process using QT Creator and linux machine as a development platform.

In the beginning of this project I will start by making a simple calculator functionality. Later on I will add the extra functionality.

Later I'm planning on adding more advanced features to the app which may include the following:

-Enthalpy calculation for humid air

-Calculation of absolute humidity from temperature and relative humidity

-Dew point calculation using relative humidity and temperature

-Air flow calculations from given k value of a fan or damper using pressure difference to calculate air flow

-Energy/Power calculation for water flow in cooling or heating systems using water flow and deltaT. Maybe additional functions for calculation for systems with different types of brine solutions and different concentrations of additives not just pure water loops.

-With my professional background in refrigeration industry would also be nice to add calculation of different things in refrigeration systems for refrigerants like R744 (CO2) etc.

-Simple electrical calculations for resistance, current, voltage, power and more. 

Goal is to end up with usable app that I could use for work offline and not having to rely on online tools for calculations. This could make my work easier troubleshooting automation (BMS) and refrigeration systems by making it faster to calculate certain things.
