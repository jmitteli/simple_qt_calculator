# simple_qt_calculator
Simple calculator app created using QT Creator


#Project goals

The purpose of this project is to make myself more familiar with the development process using QT Creator and linux machine as a development platform.

In the beginning of this project I will start by making a simple calculator functionality. 

Later I'm planning on adding more advanced features to the app which may include the following:

-Enthalpy calculation for humid air

-Calculation of absolute humidity from temperature and relative humidity

-Dew point calculation using relative humidity and temperature

-Air flow calculations from given k value of a fan or damper

-Energy/Power calculation for water flow in cooling or heating systems using water flow and deltaT
